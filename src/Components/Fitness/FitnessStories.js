      title:'ELBOW PLANK',
      para:'Plank pose is most commonly used as a transitional pose, moving the body from high to lower planes, and vice versa. It is used within the sun salutation (surya namaskara) sequences and vinyasa sequences, as the yogi steps back to plank and lowers into chatturanga. Plank pose is also known as a pose in its own right, and is often held for long periods of time to build strength, heat, and energy in the body. Because plank pose requires a certain extent of strength and endurance, it is an ideal pose to refocus and re-energize, and overcome from sluggish energy or ‘stuck’ emotions.'

      title:'DHANURASANA POSE',
      para:'Bow Pose (Dhanurasana) is an intermediate yoga pose similar to a backbend. It’s one of the 12 basic Hatha Yoga poses. By lifting your torso up and backward, the chest is opened and the back is deeply stretched. This pose is a great way to deeply stretch the back after a long day of hunching over.'
